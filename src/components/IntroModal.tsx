        This is a simple calendar app that allows you to view and manage your
        events. Everything is stored locally! So 100% privacy, but you also
        can't access your events from other devices nor share them with others.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can switch between day, week, and month views using the controls in
        the bottom navigation panel.
      </p>
      <p>
        To create an event, click on the "+" button in the corner of the
        navigation panel. You can then fill out the details and save it to your
        calendar.
      </p>
      <p>
        To edit or delete an event, click on the event in the calendar view. You
        can then make your changes and save them.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can access additional settings by clicking on the gear icon in the
        top right corner.
      </p>
      <p>That's it! Enjoy using lo-cal! ðŸ˜Š</p>
